<p>
    If you want to contribute to the O-FISH application, find an issue to solve:<br>
        <ol>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/WildAid/o-fish-android/issues">Android mobile app issues</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/WildAid/o-fish-ios/issues">iOS mobile app issues</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/WildAid/o-fish-web/issues">React web app issues</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/WildAid/o-fish-realm/issues">Realm backend</a></li>
        </ol>
</p>
<p>
    You will need to fork the appropriate code repository (<a href="https://github.com/WildAid/o-fish-android">Android</a>, <a href="https://github.com/WildAid/o-fish-ios">iOS</a>, <a href="https://github.com/WildAid/o-fish-web">Web</a>, <a href="https://github.com/WildAid/o-fish-realm">Realm</a>). You then need to checkout your new fork. For example:
</p>
<code>
git clone https://github.com/my-github-name/o-fish-web.git
cd o-fish-web
</code>
<p>
    Track changes from the original repo:
</p>
<code>
git remote add --track main upstream https://github.com/WildAid/o-fish-web.git
git fetch upstream
</code>
<p>
    Create and switch to a new branch on your fork:
</p>
<code>
git checkout -b fix_issue_12345 upstream/main
</code>
<p>
    Code your fix and <a href="/build">build the O-FISH application</a> to test that it works.
</p>
<p>
    Once you verify the issue is fixed, you will need to submit your edits to your fork's branch, commit, and push, e.g.:
</p>
<code>
git add .
git commit -m 'fixing issue 12345'
git push -u origin fix_issue_12345
</code>
<p>
    Create a pull request as the output instructs by following the instructions given in the output from the previous command:
</p>
<code>
remote: Create a pull request for 'fix_issue_12345' on GitHub by visiting:
remote:      https://github.com/my-github-name/o-fish-web/pull/new/fix_issue_12345    
</code>
<p>
    A developer will review your code, and once the code is ready it will be merged in.
