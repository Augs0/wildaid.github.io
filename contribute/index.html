If you want to contribute to the O-FISH application, find an issue to solve:<BR>
<OL><LI><A HREF="https://github.com/WildAid/o-fish-android/issues">Android mobile app issues</A>
</LI><LI><A HREF="https://github.com/WildAid/o-fish-ios/issues">iOS mobile app issues</A>
</LI><LI><A HREF="https://github.com/WildAid/o-fish-web/issues">Node.js web app issues</A>
</LI></OL>

You will need to fork the appropriate code repository (<A HREF="https://github.com/WildAid/o-fish-android">Android</A>, <A HREF="https://github.com/WildAid/o-fish-ios">iOS</A>, <A HREF="https://github.com/WildAid/o-fish-web">Web</A>) and create a NEW BRANCH to code your fix. For example, to clone the web app and create a branch called 'patch_to_fix_issue_12345':<BR><BR>
<CODE>git clone https://github.com/WildAid/o-fish-web<BR>
git branch patch_to_fix_issue_12345</CODE><BR><BR>

Code your fix and <A HREF="/build">build the O-FISH application</A> to test that it works.<BR><BR>

Once you verify the issue is fixed, you will need to submit your patch to the github code. Commit, and push, e.g.:<BR><BR>

<CODE>git commit -m 'fixing issue 12345'<BR>
git push origin patch_to_fix_issue_12345</CODE><BR><BR>

A developer will review your code, and once the code is ready it will be merged in.<BR><BR>
