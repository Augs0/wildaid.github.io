# The Home Screen
On the home screen, there are a few sections. The top section includes a search bar to "Find Records" and an avatar (the avatar is circled in blue). Then there is a map, and a button to board the vessel:<BR>

The blue dot on the map indicates your location. Also shown is your latitude and longitude in degrees, minutes and seconds. Use 2 fingers to pinch or spread to zoom in or out.

To cancel logging out and go back to the home screen, tap outside of the user information box (greyed out areas). 

# Marking Time At Sea

# Boarding a Vessel/Pre-Boarding Search
When boarding a vessel, it saves time if the app can use information from a previous record. When you select the "Find Records" bar or the "Board Vessel" button, you will see a page that shows the 5 most recent vessels boarded:<BR>

You can select any of the records shown, or type the first part of the vessel name to search to find matching records. In this example, we have typed "pred" and can see a vessel called "Predator":<BR>
